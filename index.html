            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p><strong>The Thin Man</strong>, American detective film, released in 1934, that was considered a paragon of the fun, sophisticated, glib dramas produced by Hollywood during the Great Depression.<br> 
              The film is the first in a popular series of detective films featuring <strong>William Powell</strong> as the dapper detective <em>Nick Charles</em> and <strong>Myrna Loy</strong> as his witty and irresistible wife, <em>Nora</em>. 
              The Thin Man is based on the 1934 novel of the same name by <strong>Dashiell Hammett</strong>.</p>

          <div class="main__content__description__plot">
            <h1>Plot</h1>
            <p><em>Nick Charles</em>, a retired detective, and his wealthy wife <em>Nora</em>, live in San Francisco but are visiting New York City for Christmas. There, <em>Nick</em> is pressed back into service by <em>Dorothy Wynant</em>, a young woman whose father, <em>Clyde</em>, was an old client of Nick's. <br>
            Clyde, the title's "thin man", was supposed to be on a secret business trip and promised to be home before his daughter's wedding, but has mysteriously vanished. She convinces Nick to take the case, with the assistance of his socialite wife, eager to see him in action.<br> 
            What appears to be a missing person case turns into a murder case when Julia Wolf, Clyde's former secretary and love interest, is found dead, and evidence points to Clyde as the prime suspect. Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty. 
            The detective uncovers clues and eventually solves the mystery of the disappearance.</p>
            <p>The murderer is exposed at a dinner party: A skeletonized body, found buried in Wynant's workshop during the investigation, had been assumed to be that of a "fat man" because it was wearing oversized clothing. 
            However, Nick alleges that the clothes were planted to hide the true identity of the body, which still has shrapnel from an old war wound in one leg and belongs to a "thin man": the missing Wynant. <br>Nick deduces that the real culprit murdered Clyde once Clyde found out he had been embezzling from him, then murdered Julia who knew about Clyde's murder, then also murdered Nunheim, who witnessed Julia's murder.
            Nick reveals the identity of the killer as Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCauley. Panicked, MacCauley tries to shoot Nick, but Nick punches him out.
            Finally, Nick and Nora, as well as Dorothy and her new husband Tommy, celebrate as they take a train back to California.</p>

            <h1>Reception</h1>
            <p>The film was released on May 25, 1934 to extremely positive reviews and was a box office hit, with special praise for the chemistry between Loy and Powell. 
            <ul>Some reactions:
              <li>Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it "an excellent combination of comedy and excitement"</li>
              <li>John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that Loy and Powell played their parts "beautifully", adding, "All the people of the book are there, and I think the final scenes of the solution of the mystery are handled on a higher note than they were in print."</li>
              <li>Louella Parsons called it "the greatest entertainment, the most fun and the best mystery-drama of the year."</li>
              <li>Harrison Carroll of The Los Angeles Herald-Express wrote that it was "one of the cleverest adaptations of a popular novel that Hollywood has ever turned out."</li>
              <li>Film historian Andrew Sarris - Nick and Nora were the first on-screen Hollywood couple for whom matrimony did not signal the end of sex, romance and adventure.</li>
